      <p>Welcome to my slice of the internet! üíÉüèΩ</p>
      <p>
        Where curiosity meets code and everything in between. I'm an Introverted Omnivert Software
        Engineer and DevOps Engineer specializing in Cloud Automation and
        AlOps-turning complex systems into smooth, automated workflows. 
        When I'm not deep in scripts, you can find me:
        
        ‚Ä¢ Obsessing over F1üèé, cheering for my team Ferrari~Lewis Hamilton(LH44üíú)(where Lewis Hamilton goes i goüòÇ), and analyzing every race strategy.
        
        ‚Ä¢ Perfecting my bash game (because automation should be effortless, right?).

        ‚Ä¢ Exploring new cuisines, pairing them with the a perfect glass of wine or a bold tequila find.

        ‚Ä¢ Getting lost in a book, always chasing my next great read.

        ‚Ä¢ Jamming to music, because life's better with the right playlist. OH! How i love music Gosh! Music brings me peace and i'd choose music over people anyday anytimeüòÇ. A Music lover with a genre-fluid-taste, if it sounds good, it's on my playlist.

        ‚Ä¢ Wandering to new places, soaking in the beauty of the world (especially golden hour sunsetsüåÖ).

        ‚Ä¢ Cheering Las Vegas Aces(LVAüèÄ), because basketball runs deep.

        ‚Ä¢ I love flowers, because nature's beauty never gets old.

        ‚Ä¢ Hanging out with dogs, the best companions ever. I love siberian huskies and Alaskan malamute breeds, there's certainly nothing boring about them. Very Amazing breeds.

        ‚Ä¢ Indulging in confectionery, because life is sweeeter with a treat.

        ‚Ä¢ Fueling up on coffee, because good code (and great ideas) start with a strong brew.

        ‚Ä¢ Obsessed with fragrances, because smelling good is a whole vibe.

        ‚Ä¢ Drawn to anything nice, because life's too short for anything less.

        ‚Ä¢ Passionate about interior design, because a well-curated space is pure art.

        ‚Ä¢ Loving fashion and beauty, because style and self-care are the ultimate confidence boosters.

        ‚Ä¢ Techie at heart, always geeking out over automation and cloud innovations.

        ‚Ä¢ Big on experiences, because memories > material things.

        ‚Ä¢ A sucker for deep conversations, the kind that make  you question everything and spark new ideas.

        ‚Ä¢ Lover for aesthetics, because whether it's a well-designed app, a cozy space, or a killer outfit-details matter.

        ‚Ä¢ Night owl tendencies, because the best ideas sometimes come at 2 Am.üòÇ

        ‚Ä¢ An old soul, drawn to timeless music, vintage vibes, and a simple joys of life.

        ‚Ä¢ A full-brown speed junkie, Obsessed with sporty cars, because speed, power, and design are pure adrenaline

        I'm always on the lookout for new challenges, experiments, and cool ways to make technology bend to my will.

        If things get messy around here, blame it on my experiments-turns out, even automation can't fix everything.

        I'm always on the lookout
